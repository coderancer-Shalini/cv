      <p>
        I have been learning Bharathanatyam for the past 10 years.
        I love dancing and have performed in Navarathri programmes, Margazhi Dance festivals and Sabha programmes.
        I even took part in <em>"Bharatha Mazhai 5050"</em>dance event that entered the Guiness Book of Records.
